# Introduction


## Extension

**Hash Bang**

`#!/bin/bash`

The Hash Bang is a Kernel convention and helps the Kernel in deciding the interpreter.

No extension is needed if we add `#!/bin/bash` as the first line in the script

**.sh** If we do not provide the Hash Bang

## Execution

To execute bash scripts the user should have permissions to execute the script.

```bash
# check the current user
$ whoami
# check if the current user has executable permission
$ ls -l script.sh
# if no executable permission add executable permission
$ chmod u+x script.sh
```
