# Files

- Read a file

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    value=`cat file.txt`
    echo $value
    echo `cat file.txt`
    ```

- Read file line by line

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    while read line;
    do
    	echo $line
    done < file.txt
    
    # prevent backslash escapes
    while read -r line;
    do
    	echo $line
    done < file.txt
    
    # prevent trimming leading or trailing whitespaces
    while IFS= read line;
    do
    	echo $line
    done < file.txt
    ```

- Write to a file

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    file=bash.txt
    
    # create a log file or overrite if already present
    printf "Bash File -" > $file
    
    # append data to log file
    date >> $file
    
    echo "appending data to a file" >> $file
    ```

- Check if a file exists

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    if [ -e /bash.txt ];
    then
    	echo "bash.txt exists"
    else
    	echo "bash.txt doesnot exit"
    fi
    ```

- Check if file exists and is a directory

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    if [ -d /tutorial ];
    then
    	echo "tutorial is a directory"
    else
    	echo "tutorial is not a directory"
    fi
    ```

- Check if file is readable

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    if [ -r bash.txt ];
    then
    	echo "file is readable"
    else
    	echo "file is not readable"
    fi
    ```

- Replace string in a file

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Syntax: sed -i "s/old/new" filename
    # sed => stream editor
    # s => substitute
    
    old="hello"
    new="apple"
    filename="bash.txt"
    sed -i "s/$old/$new/" $filename
    ```
